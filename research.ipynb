    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "We plan to study the relationship between energy price fluctuations and macroeconomic outcomes, with a particular focus on how short-term energy price shocks transmit into broader economic indicators such as inflation and industrial activity.\n",
    "More broadly, the project aims to explore how high-frequency energy market data can be used to understand economic volatility and policy-relevant dynamics in real time. Moreover, we also focus on the environmental externalities of energy consumption, analyzing its impact on indicators such as air quality."

    "# 5. Know/Unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "Known:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, wholesale electricity prices such as LBMP are highly sensitive to short-term demand fluctuations. During peak demand hours, marginal generation units with higher production costs are dispatched, leading to sharp price increases. This mechanism is well-documented in electricity market theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the fuel mix plays a crucial role in price formation. In NYISO, natural gas-fired plants frequently serve as marginal generators due to their operational flexibility and significant share in load-following capacity. As a result, wholesale electricity prices are expected to exhibit strong sensitivity to natural gas price fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unknow: \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these stylized facts, several important uncertainties remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the magnitude and timing of the dynamic adjustment between demand shocks and LBMP are unclear. It is not obvious whether price responses are immediate, persistent, or asymmetric across peak and off-peak periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the intraday variation in fuel mix and its interaction with demand remains underexplored. It is uncertain whether renewable penetration significantly moderates price spikes or merely shifts volatility across hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, while natural gas prices are expected to influence LBMP, the strength and stability of this pass-through over time remain empirical questions. Structural changes in the energy market may alter this relationship.\n"

    "# 6. Expected challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. High-Frequency Data Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The hourly (or sub-hourly) nature of LBMP and demand data introduces substantial volatility and noise. Short-term price spikes may obscure systematic patterns, requiring careful filtering or aggregation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. External Confounding Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation) simultaneously affect demand, renewable generation, and air quality. Failing to control for these factors may bias estimated relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Air Quality Attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Air quality indicators such as PM2.5 or NO₂ are influenced by multiple emission sources beyond electricity generation (e.g., transportation, industrial activity). Isolating the contribution of electricity demand may therefore require additional controls or robustness checks.\n"
