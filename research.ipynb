    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "We plan to study the relationship between energy price fluctuations and macroeconomic outcomes, with a particular focus on how short-term energy price shocks transmit into broader economic indicators such as inflation and industrial activity.\n",
    "More broadly, the project aims to explore how high-frequency energy market data can be used to understand economic volatility and policy-relevant dynamics in real time. Moreover, we also focus on the environmental externalities of energy consumption, analyzing its impact on indicators such as air quality."

    "# 6. Expected challenges\n",
    "Data availability and quality: Suitable, high-frequency, and comparable datasets may be difficult to obtain, particularly for cross-country analysis. Regarding Q1, It may be challenging to identify appropriate indicators that capture the change in supply-demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weak or ambiguous empirical relationships: The relationships of interest may be statistically weak or obscured by noise, making it difficult to identify clear patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation versus causation: Observed associations may reflect correlation rather than causal effects, limiting the strength of policy conclusions.\n",

    "Visualization constraints: Some relationships may be difficult to represent clearly through visualizations alone, especially when multiple confounding factors are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretive limitations: Findings may be highly aggregated or context-specific, resulting in conclusions that are broad but offer limited actionable insight."
